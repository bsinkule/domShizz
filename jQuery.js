// console.log() below to make sure your JQuery is properly connected
console.log('hey uhhhhhh')
console.log($)

// Create 4 variables to select four elements on the page. 
// Your variables should select h1, p, and id and a class.
// Log the variables to the console, observe the result.
var heading = $('#mainpicture')
console.log(heading)
// or '.class' or 
var newThing = $('<h1>meow</h1>')
$('body').append(newThing)

// PART TWO
// The time of the bears ruling things is over. Lets use DOM manipulation to give power
// to our true overlords CORGIS
var newNewH = $("h1");
console.log(newNewH)
newNewH = "CORGIS!"

// Lets start by changing the text of the H1 to read "CORGIS!"
// Don't forget to select the h1 before trying to change the text

// Do the same thing with the paragraph tag. It should read
// "Two types of corgi lords, Pembroke and Cardigan"

// Cool we are on our way to spreading the good news about our new
// overlords but the site needs more work

// Lets change the image source to be a picture of a corgi of your choosing

// Lets change the class of the lis to be "corgitype"

// Now set the text of each li to be Pembroke and Cardigan

// Change the color of the H1 to be your favorite color


// PART THREE

// Using HTML add a button (maybe give it an id for easy targeting) to the page and style it as you wish

// Add an event listener to the button that prints to the console 'I was clicked'

// Now lets give that button some functionality. I want to start a counter keeps track of how many times the button was clicked

// Instead of printing to the console make the coutner appear somewhere on the webpage

// GREAT WORK

// Lets get rid of the counter but keep the button. When the  button is clicked add a picture of a corgi.

// SAND BOX
//  There is so much we can do with event listeners and DOM
//  Look up differnt jQuery methods and make this page your own
